# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Login and tdata

- Rebuilt the login flow on a custom phone authenticator: code delivery method
  and length, resend with countdown, retry after an invalid code, 2FA password
  hint and flood-wait countdown.
- Structured `auth:event` payloads for QR expiry, code type/length/timeout,
  resend state, password hint, flood wait and tdata export result.
- Rewrote the Telegram Desktop exporter to match the official layout exactly:
  `key_datas`, `D877F783D5D3EF8Cs` and `D877F783D5D3EF8C/maps`, TDF$ hashes,
  encrypted descriptors, wide-id MTP authorization and random padding. Only the
  modern `s` suffix is written; stale `0`/`1` files are removed.
- Validated the generated tdata with official portable Telegram Desktop 7.2.5
  (build 7002005): accounts info, map, MTP keys and account startup are read
  successfully.
- Import now compares the authorization identity (user id + main DC + key id)
  instead of file timestamps, so Telegram Desktop rewriting its tdata does not
  re-import the same login or replace the cached display name.
- Export record in `data/tdata-export.json`; auth backup in
  `data/tdata-backup/`; `TDataExport`/`AuthStatus.TData` exposed to the UI.

### UI

- Google Material 3 login surface: Roboto, light surface, 28px card radius,
  filled pill actions, Material 3 color roles, tonal feature icons and a
  responsive brand panel.
- Searchable country/region picker with 224 entries, `+86` default and
  international formatting (`+886 905462282` normalized to `+886905462282`).
- QR code shows a live expiry countdown, auto-refreshes when Telegram rotates
  the token, and offers a manual refresh when expired.
- Code step shows the delivery method, expected length, resend countdown and
  localized Telegram errors (flood wait, invalid/expired code, unavailable SMS,
  banned/unoccupied number, session revoked).
- New tgdesk logo rolled out to the web favicon/PWA set, Windows ICO, macOS
  ICNS/DMG icon, iOS icon and Android mipmaps; caption bar follows the light
  login surface.

### Verification

- `go test ./internal/...`
- `npm run build`
- `wails3 build`
- CDP checks of welcome, phone, country picker and QR screens with no console
  errors.
- Real phone `auth.sendCode` against Telegram (`+886`) reached the code step and
  reported app delivery; `auth.resendCode` error `SEND_CODE_UNAVAILABLE` is
  surfaced with a localized hint.

## v0.1.0 — 2026-11-11

First handoff-ready desktop milestone.

### Authentication and tdata

- Real QR, phone, code and two-step verification through tdl/gotd.
- Official Telegram Desktop tdata import, with one-time fingerprint and session
  backup.
- Re-import unchanged tdata when the stored session is only an abandoned QR
  attempt, so tdata dropped next to `tgdesk.exe` still logs in.
- No-passcode official-format tdata export, validated with Telegram Desktop
  7.2.5.
- Portable session separated from official tdata.

### Chat

- Real dialog list and latest-50 message history.
- Plain-text message sending.
- Telegram-style conversation header and channel action bar.
- Message grouping, date pills, tails, read/sent indicators.
- In-chat search over loaded messages and persistent per-chat drafts.
- Forwarded messages, service messages (localized), video cards and real
  thumbnails.
- Poll results, locations and contacts.

### Downloads

- Byte-resumable media downloads with pause/resume/cancel.
- Persistent task metadata and progress events.
- Thumbnail cache separate from full media downloads.

### UI

- Frameless Wails window with a 24px Telegram-style caption bar and working
  window controls.
- Atomic login/chat/layout/settings components under the `tg-*` CSS namespace.
- 1107×725 reference geometry: sidebar 394, chat header 56, chat row 60,
  avatar 48.
- English, 简体中文 and日本語 UI.
- Minimal settings sheet: language, send-on-Enter, download folder/threads/
  template, proxy and NTP. Appearance, About and placeholder Telegram sections
  were removed to keep the app focused on chats and downloads.

### Verification

- `go test ./...`
- `tsc` / `npm run build`
- `wails3 build`
- Login and chat CDP metric checks with no console errors.
- Live thumbnail, video, poll, service-message and draft checks.

### Known limitations

- Welcome illustration is a rebuilt approximation.
- Map tiles require network and fall back to a schematic surface.
- Pin/mute/mark-read are local UI state.
- Message pagination, live updates, reactions and server-side search are not
  implemented by the current kernel.
- Passcode-protected tdata is not supported.

## Roadmap

- Real map provider integration.
- Message pagination/live updates when kernel support exists.
- Remaining settings pages.
- Further typography calibration.
